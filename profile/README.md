## 🕸️ **Why “Myco”?**

Just like **mycelium**, data architectures must be:

* **Interconnected** — enabling systems to communicate efficiently.
* **Resilient** — capable of self-repair and growth.
* **Distributed** — avoiding bottlenecks and central points of failure.
* **Adaptive** — evolving as the environment changes.

Our brand embodies these principles in every system we design.
